# agile-final-project
Coursera Optional Honors Project

In this repo u can see Zenhub integration and the use of Issues as user stories with a **As a** **I need** **So that** 
template to declare who needs which function to get a benefit. Followed by details and description and after that using Gherkin to describe the 'done' criteria with its Given When Then syntax. 

After the issues have entered the new Issue column on the Zenhub Workspace, they get labled and estimate story points to determine its workload. 
Then we decide if it gets to the Product Backlog or waiting in icebox for further dealings. Every issue in Product Backlog get refiend to the point where it become sprint ready, so the Scrum Team can work independet on the issue if it enters the Sprint Backlog.
