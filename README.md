Coursera Optional Honors Project

In this repo u can see Zenhub integration and the use of Issues as user stories with a **As a** **I need** **So that** 
template to declare who needs which function to get a benefit. Followed by details and description and after that using Gherkin to describe the 'done' criteria with its Given When Then syntax. 

After the issues have entered the new Issue column on the Zenhub Workspace, they get labled and estimate story points to determine its workload. 
Then we decide if it gets to the Product Backlog or waiting in icebox for further dealings. Every issue in Product Backlog get refactored to the point where it become sprint ready, so the Scrum Team can work independet on the issue if it enters the Sprint Backlog. The Sprint Backlog and Product Backlog is sorted from important to less important. A sprint gets filled with issues untill the the story points get to the lvl of the teams velocity but not beyond so that the team do not overcommit.

All issues inside a Sprint Backlog get self assigned from the team members. At the end of a sprint issues in process which are not completed get the points from its degree of completion and then get closed so the work done gets refelcted in the teams burndownchart. Then a new issues with the remaining workload will be created and assignd to the Product backlog. Also if there are issues not get worked on will get back to Product backlog to check i fthey aere still high priority for the next sprint.
